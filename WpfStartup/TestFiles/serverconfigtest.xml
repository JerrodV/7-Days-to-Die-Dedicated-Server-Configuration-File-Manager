  If your server has a large number of players you can increase this limit to add more wildlife. Animals don't consume as much CPU as zombies. 
  NOTE: That this doesn't cause more animals to spawn arbitrarily: The biome spawning system only spawns a certain number of animals in a given
  area, but if you have lots of players that are all spread out then you may be hitting the limit and can increase it.
