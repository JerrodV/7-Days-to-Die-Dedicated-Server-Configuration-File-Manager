*****DISCLAIMER-
*****Neither this application or the developer is in any way associated with 7 Days to Die. 
*****While the application has been designed to deal with your sensitive server files reliably,
*****it is USE AT YOUR OWN RISK and I cannot be held responsible for any ill effects that come from using it.
*****This would likely be most notable if the developers were to remove settings that if present cause the server to crash,
*****or were to alter the allowed values of a setting to where presenting the older value causes the server to crash.
*****In either case, manually editing the setting should restore the server functionality.
*****I use the program myself and will update it if I see any oddities as future server versions come out.

Instructions:

Using Seven Days Configuration UI is meant to be simple. The idea is that you load up your configuration file and edit your settings through an informative UI, then save when it is all correct. The XML write is done in such a way that any regrouping or reordering you might have done should be fine and preserved when the file is rewritten.

If at any time you have questions on what an item does, hover your mouse over the it. A tool tip will show with the original developer text as well as any (mostly) helpful information I had to offer. Note that some of the tool tip descriptions may describe settings that I have improved upon for the UI. For instance, you may see something like 0 = easy, but also see 'Easy' in the drop down list and not '0'. This is because I am doing the interpretation behind the scenes, but wanted to stay true to the idea of showing the original developer text.

Note that the application will automatically remember the last files you've looked up. If 'n/a' appears, no file path has yet been set. If a message other than the file path or 'n/a' appears, the application was not able to resolve the file path you are saving, or the one you have saved.

The UI controls are mostly self validating. In the case where free text is allowed, and the value is required, a dialog is shown warning you, the field will be highlighted in red, and you will not be able to save until the error is corrected.

Any time a file is saved, it is then reloaded into the UI. The message in the status does not reflect the reload. This is intentional.
